# AADS Fullstack Code Test

This code test test's a developers understanding of **Java/Spring** and **TypeScript/React** but puts emphasis on communicative skills and effort. The point is to review the Open Source project [Hjulverkstan](https://github.com/Hjulverkstan/hjulverkstan) that Alten has created. Some parts of the application have been given tender attention and others have not yet been reviewed. Different parts have been written by developers with varying experience ranging from not yet graduate interns to seniors. While we care to give perfection to the whole of the application, the process of this project takes time. Your review could help take the project further.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo.

Clone the repo and change the remote to a new private repo on you GitHub so that your work may be saved in a private environment – this will then by the end of the test be shared with us thourgh GitHub.

### 2. Write two Issues.

Take the time to go through the code and pick one point in the backend and one in the frontend to give feedback on, preferably that which to your attention is the **most important to improve**. At least one of the issues should find something substantial, if you do not find both parts of the stack to have needed inprovements large enough to give an interesting discussion on, instead focus on that which **peaks your interest** the most and discuss that. Let's cover what it is we want to see in the discussions you put forward:

In these reviews we are looking for how you **communicate technically** and your **unique values and interest** in system design and development, that is what makes good code to you and what makes you think that. We think that machine learning models are not yet able to give nuance enough to do this.

Write your feedback in two separate issues in you private repo. Spend at least one hour reading the code and writing your two reviews. Attention to detail within the repo is appreciated.

### 3. Write a Pull Request.

Now you are to write a PR on one of these issues. The commits(s) are to be equal to approximately on hour of development. You may have discussed something in your review that is would take more time improve, if so divide the work strategically and package your work neatly so that it could picked up by someone else to persue fruther.

Write a description in your PR to integrate you disccusion into the solution you present so that the motivation behind your work is clear.

We look for how you divide and plan your work – and of course at the code it self.

### 4. Finalise and send in.

When finished invite [Jona Cwejman](https://github.com/Cwejman) and [Azfar Imtiaz](https://github.com/azfar-imtiaz) to access the repo. We should then be able read the issues and review your PR.

Note that all of this work is done in a private repo, a clone of [hjulverkstan](https://github.com/Hjulverkstan/hjulverkstan) and not a fork – so that it is kept private. If you would like to share your work publically and contribute your feedback to the project you may do so when the inteview process is complete.
