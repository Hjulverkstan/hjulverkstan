# AADS Fullstack Code Test

This code test test's a developers understanding of **Java/Spring** and **TypeScript/React** but puts emphasis on communicative skills and effort. Without actually coding the point is to review the Open Source project [Hjulverkstan](https://github.com/Hjulverkstan/hjulverkstan) that Alten has created. Some parts of the application have been given tender attention and others have not yet. Different parts have been written by developers with varying experience ranging from not yet graduate interns to seniors. While we care to give perfection to the whole of the application, the process of this project takes time. Your review could help take the project further.

Take the time to go through the code and pick at lest one point in the backend and one in the fron end to give feedback on. Preferably that which to your attention is the **most important to improve**, if nothing is in need of improvement instead choose that which **peaks your interest** the most and explain why.

Here your ability to **technically comunicate** and show your **unique values and interest** in development is what we look for. This is something that machine learning is not able to do yet – we think. Here is an outline of how to proceed:

1. Clone the repo and change the remote to a new private repo on you GitHub.
2. After reviewing – create a an issue in your private repo covering your points of feedback. **Approximately two hours of your time** should be enough to pin point what you want to give feedback on and articulate – the target audience other developers, feel free to use what ever means nessesary in markdown to convey your agenda.
3. Bonus. Not as important as step 2, as the review should be enough to cover your techical ability, system design values and communicative abilities. If you want to write a PR in your private repo, implementing a solution based on you feedback you may do so. This can then, when the interview period is complete be moved to a fork and potentionally merged into the project. If you decide that you have time for this step treat the PR as you would one in a professional work experience.

When finnished invite [Jona Cwejman](https://github.com/Cwejman) and [Azfar Imtiaz](https://github.com/azfar-imtiaz) to access the repo.
